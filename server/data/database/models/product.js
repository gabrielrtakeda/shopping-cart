At 11.3 percent, this beer is malty and dark, with hints of plum and apricot at colder temperatures, and a complexity that only expands the closer this beer gets to true cellar temperature. A slow-sipping beer with the complexity of a fine scotch or wine, this beer has scored a perfect 100 on Rate Beer and is deemed “world class” by Beer Advocate.')

Thus, it’s available in pub draft only and is released at the brewery on the first Friday in February for two weeks only. It has a lot of hype, but it’s well deserved. There have been many imitators since Pliny the Younger first debuted in 2005, but no other triple IPA has bested the balanced, medium bitterness and a beautiful copper color of this brew.')

This is not the case for The Alchemist’s flagship brew, Heady Topper. Incredibly difficult to procure (unless you live within 20 miles of the brewery), this Vermont double IPA is beloved by beer enthusiasts around the world thanks to its intoxicating aroma and pure hop flavor that comes in waves of oranges, pine, and spice.')

Procuring a bottle is notoriously difficult; the monks are only allowed to make enough beer each month to support themselves and no more.')
